Characters are going to be fully customizable! 
Clothing, accessories, and weapons will be their own sprite sheet so that you can mix-and-match items and overlay them within your game. 
Because it's set up in a specific way, here's a little guide:

- The spritesheets are organized in "layers", determined by the number on the respective folder
- These layers are numbered 01-08, 01 being the very TOP layer, whilst 08 being the very BOTTOM
- Layers are set up so that you can mix-and-match 1 of each layer (one from each folder) for ultimate customization!

If you don't need this extra customization, I've exported Example Characters that you can use in your game.
There is also a Spritesheet Guide that showcases which frames are for which animation.
Also note that each frame is an 80x80px square in order to have space for certain animations!
